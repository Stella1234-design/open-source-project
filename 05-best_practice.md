# WI-Project: Open-Source Development

## Best Practice Session

---

# Learning objectives

Our objectives for today are to

- Discuss whether the teams encountered any challenges and how they can be addressed
- Facilitate the practical application of Git commands and Python coding from previous sessions

The focus is on **helping teams organize their work effectively**. To this end, we

- Encourage you to share challenges, errors or lessons learned
- Do not introduce new commands, except when you ask for them or when they are useful for your work

# Work status

- As a team, do you know where and how to contribute your code (modules, classes to use or create)?
- Are you confident with your setup (fork, local development, running your code, executing pre-commit hooks to improve code quality)?
    - What was particularly helpful (insights you can share with the other teams)?
    - What are the challenges we can discuss?
- How did you distribute tasks in the team (who works on what, which branches did you create, does regular sync work for you)?

# Focus sessions

- Items for the focus sessions can be suggested in the interim project assessment survey

# Best practices and conventions





- Based on student feedback

- pre-commit hooks (code quality) and tests (check whether it runs on all branches)
- Commit practices (atomic, no unrelated materials)
- Remember to sync regularly between remotes/origin and your fork

- Option: ask students to refactor their code in parallel (e.g., docstrings, variable naming, typing, breaking down methods) and merge (start from new branches)
Notes:

- A walk-through explaining colrev search and SearchSources (showing the changes in settings and records retrieved), and guidelines in testing code would be helpful.
- Refresh skills related to Git, gitk, fork, using of branches/pull-requests, issues, and merging.
- Additional resources (e.g., links to interactive tutorials)
- Explanations for gitk and Linux shell commands (ls, cs, ...)
- Workflow utilities (such as storing custom commands in bash_aliases) may be helpful.

Use [colrev-template](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev-template) in GitHub codespaces
Plan: 45 min

-> continue with the setup in https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev  (including alias etc.)
Plan: 45 min

Fragen: 30-40 min

Test and practice merge/merge conflict
