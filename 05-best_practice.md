# Best practices and conventions

- Based on student feedback
- pre-commit hooks (code quality) and tests (check whether it runs on all branches)
- Commit practices (atomic, no unrelated materials)

- Option: ask students to refactor their code in parallel (e.g., docstrings, variable naming, typing, breaking down methods) and merge (start from new branches)
