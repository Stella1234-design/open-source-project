# Best practices and conventions

- Based on student feedback
- pre-commit hooks (code quality) and tests (check whether it runs on all branches)
- Commit practices (atomic, no unrelated materials)
- Remember to sync regularly between remotes/origin and your fork

- Option: ask students to refactor their code in parallel (e.g., docstrings, variable naming, typing, breaking down methods) and merge (start from new branches)
Notes:

- A walk-through explaining colrev search and SearchSources (showing the changes in settings and records retrieved), and guidelines in testing code would be helpful.
- Refresh skills related to Git, gitk, fork, using of branches/pull-requests, issues, and merging.
- Additional resources (e.g., links to interactive tutorials)
- Explanations for gitk and Linux shell commands (ls, cs, ...)
- Workflow utilities (such as storing custom commands in bash_aliases) may be helpful.
