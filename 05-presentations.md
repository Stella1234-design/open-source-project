# The Review Session

In this session, you will **adopt the perspective of a maintainer**, i.e., a gatekeeper who takes responsibility for an open-source project by screening, improving, and integrating code contributions.

As a group, your goals are:

1. Download the code from the pull request (fork) to your local machine
2. Test whether the code works as expected
3. Debug and improve the code (if necessary)
4. Document your asessment in the pull request on GitHub and suggest to merge, revise, or reject the contribution


<!-- 
Each group gives a short summary of the contribution. Groups are then assigned to a selected pull request.
