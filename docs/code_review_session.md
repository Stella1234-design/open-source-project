# Preparation

announce date and Doodle to assign groups

Determine group matching:
- X-Y
- Y-Z

- print evaluation sheets (prefill with code evaluation)

https://digital-work-lab.github.io/open-source-project/docs/teaching_notes.html#week-12-code-review-session

- print collaboration survey

https://github.com/digital-work-lab/git-collaboration/tree/main/Evaluation

- Summarize code changes for the feedback session

# Session

Ask students to switch during the code review (allowing them to review the parts that they worked on)
-> situational (if students are very quiet/do not contribute)

Code-review session:
- ask students to read code (what does it do?)
- ask students to rewrite code
- ask students to find where methods are defined (in other parts of the codebase)
- ask students how they would debug (scenario: this method does not behave as expected, how would you debug?)

Ask students to write the feedback (send it to me via e-mail) but submit it in the evening (without telling the others which topic you worked on / possibility that we test the same project twice)

Questions (reflection):

- Generally: why did you merge into main in your fork and start the pull request from main (instead of your feature branch)?
- If we were to design a generic API class, what would be the methods that we would need to implement?
- What are the limitations of an API that should be checked for every SearchSource that we implemented?

# Evaluation

Have students complete the collaboration survey

Short break to discuss with the team

Do not announce grades / give feedback

Our feedback

Explain code changes (local)

You have completed the project and there is nothing you need to do for the project. At the same time, you can continue if you would like to.

TBD: is the branching strategy reasonable? Can we check it during/after the project? What do students think?

# After the sessions

Document the grade/comments

Commit and push the changes from repositories at /home/gerit/ownCloud/projects/Project_OSD_WS/wip/groups_ss24
