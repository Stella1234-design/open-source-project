# Syllabus

In software development, open-source development environments and open-source workflows are gaining importance and are embraced by large tech companies. Git plays a central role in this context. Since its release in 2005, the market share of the decentralized and collaborative version control system has gained a market share of approximately 90%. As a result, Git-based platforms such as GitHub and GitLab have largely displaced alternatives like SourceForge (Subversion), and even large projects like the development of the Windows operating system have migrated to Git. Today, Git is an integral part of scaling extensive and highly distributed software development projects.

Against this background, the goal of this project is to understand and use Git-based open-source workflows and development environments (e.g., pull requests, forks, and continuous integration). Within the framework of an existing open-source project, [CoLRev](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev), selected functionalities will be developed and contributed in small teams. The sub-projects will be presented in the first session of the course, and preferences for topics will be taken into account when forming groups.

At the beginning of the project, three block events are planned: (1) an overview of the open-source project and the sub-projects with subsequent topic assignment, (2) an introduction to Git, and (3) an introduction to Python. The subsequent work phase will be accompanied by targeted code markers for orientation in the project and by offering hacking sessions in groups. The code review session will take place in the last weeks of the lecture period. At that time, a completed sub-project will be reported, the results of which have been incorporated into the overarching open-source project (merged or advanced pull request).

**Gerit Wagner**  
*Assistant Professor of Information Systems*  
*Otto-Friedrich Universität Bamberg*

My name is Gerit Wagner, and I am your instructor. I enjoy coding, solving programming puzzles, and building tools that are useful for others. In this project, I invite you to contribute to one of my most significant packages: [CoLRev](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev). 

<br style="clear:both">

I use the calendly tool to schedule meetings. It gives you an up-to-date overview of available slots in my schedule, and your reservations are immediately added to my calendar (no need to go back and forth via e-mail). We can meet in person or online, whatever works best for you.

## Teaching approach

TODO:

- link to pedagogical foundations
- include safety and inclusiveness statement
- link to evaluation and improvement

## Goal and learning objectives

- Use Git and GitHub to develop code in small teams
- Write Python code and contribute to a Python package
- Familiarize with open-source development as a contributor and maintainer

{: .feedback }
"I liked the fact that we were able to work very freely and independently on our problem as a group, but that we were always able to make appointments with Prof. Wagner at very short notice if we had problems or questions. This gave me the impression that we were working we were working WITH the lecturer on the problem and finding the best solution rather than blindly choosing the first solution that came along. In my opinion, working independently on a complex problem is the most important skill that I improved with the help of the project."<br>
"The support I received throughout the project was particularly good, as was the opportunity to deal with topics that were not previously available at the university, but which can be extremely important for your professional life."

## Additional Guidelines

- **Problem-Solving Mindset**: Embrace challenges and approach problems methodically, making use of available resources and seeking help when necessary.
- **Preparation and Responsibility**: Be well-prepared for meetings and reviews, understand your code, and be able to explain your approach and decisions.
- **Ethical Considerations**: Avoid the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT for coding tasks to prevent potential copyright issues and ensure the originality of your work.
- **Open-Source Approach**: Work publicly, communicate in English, and create a professional profile on platforms like GitHub.

<!-- Not required: ... -->

Deliverables are summarized on the [main page](../index.html)

Each deliverable is an opportunity to demonstrate your proficiency with Git, Python, and CoLRev.

## Student responsibilities

<!-- (possibly a “how to succeed” section) -->

- Embrace the challenge and adopt a problem solving mindset
- Take full responsibility to set up your programming environment
- Be prepared. Know your code, be able to explain it, and ask prepared questions (Google it, consider different options)
- Do not use generative AI such as ChatGPT because you would risk copyright infringement
- Adopt an Open-Source approach (work publicly, communicate in English, create a profile)
