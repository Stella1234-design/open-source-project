## Participate

If you would like to participate, please attend the introductory session.
Details regarding registration and topic assignment will be announced during this session.
We look forward to meeting you!

## Goals

- **Hands-on experience** as a [contributor to a real open-source project](docs/hall_of_fame.html).
- **Collaborative teamwork** using modern open-source workflows (branching, pull requests) through Git and GitHub.
- **Python coding** with emphasis on **code quality** and **continuous integration** tools.
- **Contribute to real Python libraries** and complete a **code review** process.

## Outline

## Goals

After participating in the open-source project, you will have gained hands-on experience as a [contributor to a real open-source project](docs/hall_of_fame.html).
You will have worked collaboratively in a team, using state-of-the-art open-source workflows such as branching and pull requests, all managed through Git and GitHub.
By coding in Python, you will apply code quality tools and continuous integration processes to maintain high standards.
Additionally, you'll learn how to contribute to actual Python libraries and complete a code review.
While this may sound like a lot, you will gain a tremendous sense of accomplishment.
Previous participants loved the project (see [evaluations](docs/evaluations.html) and [feedback](docs/feedback.html)), and many even went on to pursue a Bachelor's thesis in this area.

## Instructor

My name is Gerit Wagner, and I am your instructor. I enjoy coding, solving programming puzzles, and building tools that are useful for others. In this project, I invite you to contribute to one of my most significant packages: [CoLRev](https://github.com/CoLRev-Environment/colrev){: target="_blank"}.
