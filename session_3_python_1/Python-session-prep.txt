git checkout tutorial_python
git rebase -i HEAD~16

git rebase main
git push -f

- checkout tutorial2 branch (tutorial branch should be available as a backup)

- before switching to tutorial/after the tutorial:
run pip3 install -e . (to take code from the right repository)

-. At the end: run pip install e in your project (otherwise, you will run the tutorial Version.
