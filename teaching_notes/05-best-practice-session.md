Verbally (learning objectives): we encourage you to share challenges/errors/lessons-learned (without evaluation or judgment)
- we will not hold errors against you - on the contrary, it we recognize it as a contribution if you articulate challenges, or share solutions

We should take notes on the work status discussion


Groups to "fix" main: OSF, Unpaywall, 

Remember: 
- Challenging task
- We recognize your efforts working in a complex environment
- We are here to help
- All groups completed their projects successfully in the last projects



Discuss where students searched, how to proceed (do not provide easy solutions)
Ask students to explain how they currently understand the task, where they would search
Key task: self-organizing, understanding code

Encouragement: all the complexity (git, python, colrev) you have managed so far already contributes to your grade (you have to stretch, but we support you, and no group has failed to deliver so far)



# Task-Splitting strategy

- Skeleton (existing or new package?) - draft method signatures (e.g., accepting a dictionary, defining a dictionary at the beginning, and calling the script using __name__ == "main")
- trying options
- Split: search / load / add_endpoint
- docs

```
def search(self, options):
    options = {"query": "term"}
    print('Started search')


if __name__ == "main":
    search()
```
